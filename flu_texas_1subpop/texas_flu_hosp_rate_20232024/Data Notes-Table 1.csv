"Data Notes: 
- Data is presented at both the statewide and public health region levels to allow for analysis across broader and more localized contexts. Texas is divided into eight public health regions. A public health region (PHR) refers to a geographical area that provides support and technical assistance to local health departments/districts.
- This project is modeled after the approach utilized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For further insights, please refer to the CDC Severe Viral Respiratory Illness dashboard: https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data-research/dashboard/illness-severity.html.

"Disclaimer: 

- Not all Texas facilities are required to report COVID-19 & Flu data on the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), therefore there can be multiple unrecorded cases.
- Psychiatric, rehabilitation, and religious non-medical hospital types are excluded from calculations.
- Facilities do not send their data at the same time interval, therefore, a data export at a given time may not capture all visits that have occurred. 
- The data provided can be used as insight for prevention and developing further predictions, but not as an official count.",,,,
