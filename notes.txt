For Dave & Sonny meeting

- IMHO: must be relentless about...
- Taking initiative and communicating it 
- Staying on task: avoiding unnecessary "related" projects, avoiding unnecessary features
- High quality code: readability and quality assurance using unit tests -- we are telling people that they need to do things differently -- have to set a good example to build trust and also demonstrate good practices

- Houston, Dallas, El Paso, Austin

- Must be able to handle immunoSEIRS model
- Must be able to handle metapopulation, age-risk groups

- Immediate use cases: bird flu, city-level transmission modeling
- Immediate users: Linda, Sonny, Remy, Susan, Kaiming, Shraddha, Anass
- Potential future users: public health officials?

- 2 tests:
-- Are the users happy with the code?
-- Are Kaiming, Shraddha, and Anass able to use this code instead of their old code?

- Modeling, calibration, optimization
