    If two subpopulations comprise a MetapopModel (travel model), then
    if there is no travel between the two subpopulations, the
    MetapopModel should behave exactly like two INDEPENDENTLY RUN
    versions of the SubpopModel instances.

    We can "turn travel off" in multiple ways:
    - Setting pairwise travel proportions to 0 (so that 0% of
        subpopulation i travels to subpopulation j, for each
        distinct i,j subpopulation pair, i != j)
    - Or setting the mobility_modifier to 0 for each
        subpopulation
    We test both of these options, one at a time

    Note -- this test will only pass when timesteps_per_day on
    each SimulationSettings is 1. This is because, for the sake of efficiency,
    for MetapopModel instances, each InteractionTerm is updated
    only ONCE PER DAY rather than after every single discretized timestep.
    In contrast, independent SubpopModel instances (not linked by any
    metapopulation/travel model) do not have any interaction terms.
    The S_to_E transition variable rate does not depend on any
    interaction terms, and depends on state variables that get updated
    at every discretized timestep.
